# Adaptive Icon Template for Adobe XD

![Adaptive Icon Template Preview](/adaptive_icon_template_xd.png?raw=true)

Android O introduces a new app icon format: adaptive icons. Adaptive icons can make devices more coherent by unifying the shape of all app icons and opening the door to interesting visual effects. Templates for Affinity and Sketch were available, so I made one for Adobe XD as well. Further reading:

### Notes
- The master icon is a symbol, editing that will reflect the changes in the five adaptations.
- The Areas group in the master symbol are 66dp and 72dp circles to indicate the safe area and the viewport. Primary designs such as a logo or symbol should be placed within the 66dp circle to guarantee that they're not clipped when the masks are applied.
